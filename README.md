# 🏨 Airbnb Hotel Booking Data Analysis  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project aims to analyze Airbnb hotel booking data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can help improve decision-making for hosts and enhance the overall guest experience.  
By exploring booking behaviors, pricing strategies, guest preferences, and host performance, the study identifies key factors that drive successful bookings and high guest satisfaction.

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
Airbnb generates vast amounts of booking data, but hosts and platform managers often struggle to extract meaningful insights. Without proper analysis, it becomes difficult to understand guest preferences, optimize pricing strategies, evaluate host performance, and identify factors influencing booking success. This leads to missed opportunities for improving occupancy rates, pricing efficiency, and guest experience.
